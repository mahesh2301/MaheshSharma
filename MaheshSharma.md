I have started my career with Chemistry, mixing the chemicals and trying to understand the science. But as I joined for the research assistant, I find "Data" is more interesting than the science. Later, I started looking various options around the world and found "Data Science" course helps me to understand the importance of data, and creating models using the AI to find the solutions.

Identifying improved approaches and enhanced solutions to business challenges are activities that drive and inspire me. Exploration, pursuit and motivation are my frameworks for success. I believe that fresh perspectives and trying new techniques help businesses evolve and grow.
